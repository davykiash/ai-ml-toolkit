# AI & ML Toolkit

Welcome to the AI & ML Toolkit repository. This toolkit is designed to provide a comprehensive suite of tools and algorithms for machine learning and artificial intelligence applications. It includes a variety of classification, regression, and clustering techniques, along with utilities for model selection and evaluation.

## Features

### Classification Techniques
This toolkit includes several classification algorithms, each suited for different kinds of data and use cases:

1. **Logistic Regression**: A fundamental technique for binary classification problems.
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification and regression.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Effective for high-dimensional spaces.
4. **Kernel SVM**: An extension of SVM that uses kernel functions.
5. **Naive Bayes**: A simple yet powerful probabilistic classifier.
6. **Decision Tree Classification**: A tree-like model of decisions.
7. **Random Forest Classification**: An ensemble of decision trees, typically used for tackling overfitting.

### Artificial Neural Network
Implementation of neural network architecture for deep learning applications, adaptable for various types of data.

### Boost Techniques
Methods to enhance the performance of weak learning models, turning them into stronger ones.

### Model Selection
Utilize the **Confusion Matrix** and **k-Fold Cross Validation** techniques for evaluating and selecting the most suitable models.

### Regression Techniques
A set of tools for analyzing and predicting continuous data:

1. **Multiple Linear Regression**: To model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables.
2. **Polynomial Regression**: An extension of linear regression that fits a non-linear relationship between the value of x and the corresponding conditional mean of y.
3. **Decision Tree Regression**: A decision support tool that uses a tree-like model of decisions.
4. **Random Forest Regression**: An ensemble learning method for regression.
5. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**: An adaptation of SVM for regression problems.

Model selection can be performed via the **R-Squared Mean**.

### Clustering Techniques
1. **Using the Elbow Method**: To find the optimal number of clusters.
2. **Visualizing Clusters**: Tools and techniques to visualize the data clusters effectively.
